- Clarify the correct computation of negative log-likelihood (NLL) and
  KL divergence in `src/benchmarks.py`. The current implementation assumes
  that circuit outputs are log-likelihoods but this needs to be verified.
- Avoid materialising the dense weight matrix when constructing Nystr√∂m
  factors in `nystromlayer.py`. The current helper `_build_factors_from`
  still loads the full matrix into memory.
